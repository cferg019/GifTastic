# GifTastic

This is an interactive web page, allowing the user to display gifs (it's pronounced 'gif') of their favorite TV shows. 

They can use the input field to add new show buttons, or click on the pre-existing options. 

When the user clicks on a button, the page will pull 25 gifs from 'GIPHY' in a still state. 

They can then click on the displayed gifs to animate them.
